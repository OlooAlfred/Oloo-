            different study on students‟ perception found out that, the 
            institutions of higher learning are facing a manageable task of 
            inventing the right pedagogies that can foster the institution‟s 
            image and improve their ranking [2].</br> This task has become 
            more challenging for the technical institutions especially in 
            delivering the technical knowledge such as in the field of 
            computing and information technology with the challenge be
            ing coping with the declining performance and skill of the 
            computing students in the fundamental area of computer pro
            gramming.</br> It was found out that in technical institution the 
            teacher-centered are dominant teaching-learning style to teach 
            computer programming which is contrary to the research in 
            learner-centered approach that is praised in the research and 
            practice to address individual learner‟s needs and to capitalize 
            on students‟ performance in providing a better teaching
            learning platform.</br> The study concluded that university‟s ad
            ministration should address this issue accordingly and to look 
            into the matter prudently in enhancing the teaching-learning as 
            how more training workshop can promote learner-centered 
            approach [2].
